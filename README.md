## Project description and scope
The project consists in designing and implementing a Museum Software System for a customer that will allow museum visitors to buy passes and loan items online. It should also allow for managers and employees to view their schedules, approve loans (if clearance permits) and store artefacts in a database. The system should be accessible through a web frontend for all users and function in a proper manner.
